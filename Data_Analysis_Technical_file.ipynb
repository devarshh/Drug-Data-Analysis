    "## Introduction\n",
    "One of the main driving forces for our group to choose the WHO – Suicide Statistics data set was because the ongoing pandemic that our generation has witnessed and is currently going through. It is no secret that during the early days of the lock-down and constant social distancing that mental health has become a very large challenge for the population. There have been many new personalities on various global social platforms such as twitter, Instagram, or Facebook, preaching about the importance of a work-life balance and good mental health. While previously the thought of mental health may have been a social stereotype, and many would believe it to be nothing, but a misnomer, facts and studies published have probed that mental health, mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder can pull people towards taking their own lives. This data set really resonated with us as students who are always under pressure to perform well and achieve greatness, we thought choosing this data would help make us aware and help us to spread knowledge amongst our close circles to destigmatize this topic that might provide a network of support for individuals considering suicide. We hoped that we could use a simple university project to convey a message no matter how minor its approach may be."

    "## Data Description:\n",
    "The dataset selected was the World Health Organization Suicide Statistic. According to the WHO the availability and quality of the data they collect on suicide and suicide attempts cannot always be fully accurate. Only ~80 members countries of WHO are able to provide good-quality data that can be used to estimate suicide rates but given the sensitivity of suicide and the idea of the illegality of suicidal behaviour there is often under reporting and misclassification of the act. Because of misclassification and under reporting, it can lead to even more problems in the data set compared to other causes of death. The reference to the data:\n",

    "Overall assessing the data, we have to keep in mind it may not be accurate for all countries as the WHO has to estimate some values because of under reporting and misclassification because of the stigma and taboo around the act. \n"

    "## Analysis of the Data:\n",
    "Overall, the data represents number of suicides for every country per year from 1979 to 2017. So, the overall feature of the data set include Country, Year, Sex, Age, Number of Suicides, Population of Country. In the data 141 countries we present to be referenced. As WHO cannot estimate data entirely and some countries are not recognized officially from the WHO the overall data set contain only 141. The range of data starts at the earliest from 1979 to the latest being of 2017.  Though it is apparent that not all 141 countries have data represented for every year. There are only two genders recorded in the data set by WHO. The data is organized into 6 ranges of ages to be reported. Those being: 5-14 → 15-24 → 25-34 → 35 – 54 → 55-74 → 75+. The last two features of the data rea number of suicides and number of all living people per country. \n",
    "There are a number of ways that can be chosen to organize the data. We can organise it per year or country, and that can be chosen, if necessary, when using the data to find conclusions and create hypothesis. Some early cleaning completed on the data set includes the removal of the word 'years' from the age column, formatting ages to be easily read by code, for example changing 5-14 years range to 05-14. As some data is present for some countries and some is not, and it is varying from year to year we also clean the data to remove any Nans in the columns. \n"

    "The usage of rates is self-evident, because the sheer number of suicides is proportional to the population size: the larger the country, the more suicides. What's less evident is that these rates, also known as crude rates, make it impossible to compare nations properly. Suicide rates fluctuate greatly based on demographic groupings, as we will see, therefore while looking at a country as a whole, one must consider its existing demographic composition. This is why the World Health Organization (WHO) employs age-standardized rates as well."

I would like to refer back to the place in our project where we raised an important question; what are the causes or reasons behind some of these suicides? The question is broad enough and does not possess any one correct answer. \n",
    "Upon brain storming, reading multiple suicide prevention articles and kaggle analysis reports we came up with a data science application as an extension of the selected data that can be a valuable resource and stand substantial even in real life settings. There might be numerous reasons for such a high number of suicide rate. It's a broad aspect which cannot be correctly answered without any substantial proof. However, the results that we achieved after detailed analysis of the data can guide us towards the correct direction for finding the actual cause for such high numbers. For instance some features that could be added to the data set that would add a lot of context to the data and help readers understand it easier of what we are trying to convey are: \n",
    "\n",
    "                - Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per contry\n",
    "                - Standard of Living per country\n",
    "                - Availability of Resources regarding mental health\n",
    "                - Strict Laws relating to personal growth\n",
    "                \n",
    "As can be seen just a few more statistics to add context to data could lead a long way to be able to describe further ideas regarding data science. Knowing GDP of countries included here, would allow us to cross-reference easily between the two statistics and allow for further conclusion making and further hypothesis to form to help grasp the true nature of any conclusion we made previously before further analyzation could be completed. Standard of living can be another aspect that could greatly deepen our knowledge of aspects of the data as though countries may produce good at a good rate and be trading freely over the world the standard of living could really add depth and further layers of analysis that could be attempted to come to a true as can be conclusion.

    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "Overall, the exploratory data analysis alongside general analysis of the data did reveal quite a bit about the chosen data set and was able to answer some of the question that were proposed to be discussed in the proposal section of this assignment. Understanding that a few more context adding feature could really increase the limitations of the current version of the data set we can look come to conclusion of some rudimentary aspects relating the number of suicides per country and relating that to different genders numbers as well as the overall ratio between suicides and overall population of a country. It important to remember that when looking at the data context matters allot. For example, when looking at total amount of suicides per country Spain and Macau are rated beside each other in the statistics but with context added and comparing total populations of the individual countries and coming up with a ratio a clear conclusion can be drawn that Spain has a much less suicide rate compared Macau. On the other had it important to keep in mind of incorrect reporting and underreporting of suicide statistic by some countries and therefore if a country rank low in suicide rate vs country it does not immediately point to positive signs. Overall, the data was organised and represented in many different ways in the analytical report including suicide per age regardless of country and population. The data was also organised to show suicides differing by gender and further on. Overall, we believe the original object of report was met and we gain deeper knowledge of the original data set through the use of skills learned about data analysis. Skills such as data selection, cleaning, organising we a important tool to be able to complete the project with a sense of accomplishment while leaving with a clear idea of ways to improve upon given another iteration.
